What type of machine learning problem is this?\n","regression problem.predicting a continuous numerical value (temperature) based on input features (humidity and wind speed).\n","2. How do the features relate to each other and to the weather conditions?\n","The features (humidity and wind speed) likely relate to weather conditions as follows:\n","Humidity: Higher humidity might lead to lower temperatures, as moist air tends to retain heat less effectively.\n","Wind Speed: Wind speed could influence temperature by affecting heat transfer (e.g., wind chill factor).\n","However, the exact relationships can vary based on local climate patterns and other factors.\n","3. What are the steps involved in preprocessing\n","Preprocessing is crucial for ML models:\n","-Data Cleaning: Handle missing values (impute or drop), remove duplicates, and correct anomalies.\n","-Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to a common scale.\n","-Feature Engineering: Create new features (e.g., interaction terms) or transform existing ones (e.g., log-transform).\n","-Train-Test Split: Divide data into training and testing sets.\n","-Outlier Detection/Handling: Address outliers that might affect model performance.\n","-Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical features (if any) into numerical representations.\n","-Feature Selection: Choose relevant features (if needed).\n","4. How do we select the best model for our dataset?\n","To select the best model:\n","-Train and evaluate different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.).\n","-Compare their performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) on the test set.\n","-Choose the model with the best trade-off between bias and variance.\n","5. What metrics should we use to evaluate the performance of our weather prediction model?\n","Common metrics for regression models:\n","-Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n","-R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model (higher is better).\n","-Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average absolute differences.\n","-Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE (interpretable in the same units as the target variable).\n","6. Plot the predicted vs true values?\n","You can create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents true temperature values, and the y-axis represents predicted temperature values. Each point corresponds to a test data point, and the closer the points are to the diagonal line (y = x), the better the model’s predictions.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ivPNjrtswzQY"}}]}
